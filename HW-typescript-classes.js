// typescript homework 

// typescript helps you write more robust code during development and compile time
// it does this through primitive types definitions, interfaces, and type annotations
// typescript only exists during development, and just nags you if you do something wrong
// it doesnt run in the browser or node, it compiles to javascript
// (you can run it with bun & deno directly though )
// it does not exist in the compiled code, so it does not slow down your code



// 1. make a typescript file
// 2. make an interface for a person
// hint: use the "interface" keyword

// 3. make a class for a person
// hint: use the "class" keyword
// hint: use the "constructor" keyword
// hint: the class and the interface should look kind of similar, as they both describe
// the properties and methods of the same thing

// why do we use classes and interfaces?
// whats the difference between them?

// interfaces (and typescript in general) are a way to make our code more robust 
// during DEVELOPMENT and COMPILE TIME 

// classes are a way to make our code more robust during RUNTIME

// 4. make a person!
// hint: use the "new" keyword
// hint: run the file with:
// "tsx ts-node HW-typescript.ts" 
// or "deno run HW-typescript.ts"
// or "bun run HW-typescript.ts"
// or "tsc HW-typescript.ts" and then "node HW-typescript.js"

// 5. make a function called "printPerson" that takes a person as an argument
// hint: use the "function" keyword
// hint: use the "console.log" function
// 6. call the "printPerson" function with the person you made

// 7. make a function called "getPerson" that returns a person
// hint: use the "function" keyword
// hint: use the "return" keyword
// 8. call the "getPerson" function and store the result in a variable
// 9. call the "printPerson" function with the person you got from the "getPerson" function
