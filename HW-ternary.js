// javascript ternary operator

// ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if statement
// its useful when you want to assign a value to a variable based on a condition

// syntax:
// condition ? value if true : value if false

// example:
let x = 5
let y = x > 10 ? 10 : x
console.log(y) // 5

// HOMEWORK: 
// 1. write a ternary operator that assigns a value to a variable based on a condition (like a variable that is either true or false (a boolean))

// 2. write a ternary operator that assigns a value to a variable based on a condition and uses another ternary operator as one of the values
